# 7. Conclusion

This project presents a lightweight 3D diffusion generation framework based on voxels, exploring a method for 3D generation under label guidance. By combining low-resolution voxels and an optimized 3D UNet architecture, the proposed approach not only reduces computational cost but also provides a stable and reproducible baseline model for teaching practice and rapid experiments.

## Main Contributions

- **Lightweight Framework**  
  Utilizing low-resolution voxels (16×16×16) and a streamlined network architecture, it effectively reduces computational overhead.

- **Conditional Generation Mechanism**  
  By integrating label embedding techniques, it achieves generation control based on semantic information, enabling the generation of basic geometric shapes (such as spheres, cubes, and pyramids) as well as composite objects (such as table-chair combinations) for different categories.

- **Dynamic Data Augmentation**  
  Utilizing random color strategies and shape combinations to construct a diverse synthetic dataset, it effectively alleviates overfitting and enhances model adaptability.

## Limitations and Future Outlook

- Due to the limitations of voxel resolution and computational resources, the generated details are relatively coarse, making it difficult to capture the intricate features of complex objects.  
- The granularity of conditional control is relatively coarse; future work should further improve the regulation precision of fine-grained attributes such as size and texture.

In conclusion, this paper demonstrates a new perspective on 3D generation using diffusion models, which not only holds potential academic value but also provides a practical reference for related teaching practices.
