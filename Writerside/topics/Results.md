### Detailed Analysis of the Loss Plot

#### Left Panel: Comparison of Different Batch Sizes

- X-axis (Epoch): Number of training iterations.
- Y-axis (Loss): Training loss.

Observations:
1. Initial Loss (around Epoch 0):
   - Batch Size 8 (blue curve) starts at approximately 0.3.
   - Batch Size 16 (orange curve) shows a slightly higher initial loss, around 0.4.
   - Batch Size 32 (green curve) begins near 0.5.
   - Batch Size 64 (red curve) exhibits the highest initial loss of about 0.8.

2. Convergence Behavior:
   - The blue curve (Batch Size 8) quickly reduces below 0.2 in early epochs and eventually converges to roughly 0.05.
   - The orange curve (Batch Size 16) decreases at a similar pace, converging near 0.1.
   - The green curve (Batch Size 32) declines moderately, with the loss stabilizing between 0.08 and 0.1.
   - The red curve (Batch Size 64) shows a slower descent, ultimately stabilizing around 0.15.

3. Summary:
   - Under a fixed learning rate (1e-4), smaller batch sizes (e.g., 8 or 16) facilitate a faster decrease in loss and achieve lower convergence values, although they may lead to instability and longer training time per epoch.
   - Conversely, larger batch sizes (e.g., 64) exhibit a slower decline but ensure more stable training due to processing more samples per update.

#### Right Panel: Comparison of Different Learning Rates (for Batch Size 16)

- X-axis (Epoch): Number of training iterations.
- Y-axis (Loss): Training loss.
- Curve Colors Represent:
  - Blue: LR = 1e-1
  - Orange: LR = 1e-2
  - Green: LR = 1e-3
  - Red: LR = 1e-4

Observations:
1. Initial Loss (Epoch 0):
   - Higher learning rates (e.g., 1e-1, blue curve) result in a higher and more volatile initial loss.
   - Lower learning rates (1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4) demonstrate more stable initial loss values.

2. Convergence Behavior:
   - The blue curve (LR = 1e-1) drops from approximately 1.5 to about 1.0, then oscillates between 0.8 and 1.0.
   - The orange curve (LR = 1e-2) descends from around 1.0 to 0.6â€“0.7.
   - The green curve (LR = 1e-3) starts at about 0.5, decreasing steadily to below 0.2 and stabilizing near 0.1.
   - The red curve (LR = 1e-4) begins comparatively low and continuously declines below 0.1.

3. Summary:
   - Excessively high learning rates (1e-1) may yield rapid initial improvements but can also cause oscillations that hinder achieving low loss levels.
   - Lower rates (1e-3 and 1e-4) produce a smoother and more stable descent, reaching lower ultimate loss values despite a slower reduction at the outset.

#### Overall Summary

1. Smaller batch sizes promote faster loss reduction but may incur longer per-epoch training times and potential instability.
2. Larger batch sizes ensure stability at the cost of a slower convergence rate.
3. An optimal balance between batch size and learning rate is crucial.

## Forward Diffusion

![forward_diff](forward_diff.png)

The forward diffusion process illustrates the gradual transition of data from its original state to being covered by Gaussian noise. This process intuitively reflects the changing trends in data distribution, providing a basis for later models to extract meaningful features under noisy conditions.

## Reverse Diffusion

The reverse diffusion stage gradually removes the noise and successfully restores the main features of the data. This process verifies the model's efficiency in detail recovery and structural reconstruction, gradually restoring the full original view.
