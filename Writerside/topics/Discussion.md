# 6. Discussion

In this section, we discuss the main advantages, limitations, and future directions of the 3D voxel diffusion model. Overall, the model demonstrates unique strengths in data generation, framework flexibility, and network architecture while facing challenges such as computational resources, resolution, and conditional control.

## Advantages

Firstly, the custom dataset (DummyDataset) employed by the model dynamically generates various 3D shapes (such as spheres, cuboids, pyramids, tables, and chairs) using random color strategies. This effectively enhances the model's generalization ability for geometric patterns and color distributions, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Secondly, the diffusion module supports both linear and cosine noise schedules; when combined with DDIM sampling, it enables adaptive adjustments during training and accelerates generation, while allowing for conditional guidance using predefined labels (e.g., "chair" or "table"). Finally, the VoxelUNet, constructed with 3D convolutions, residual blocks, and attention mechanisms, is capable of capturing multi-scale spatial dependencies in voxel data. With the inclusion of time and label embeddings, the model exhibits notable robustness in conditional generation tasks.

## Limitations

Despite its strengths, the model still faces high computational costs during training and inference, especially when operating at high voxel resolutions (e.g., 64^3), which places significant demands on hardware resources. Additionally, the low-resolution voxels result in coarse geometric details, limiting the reproduction of intricate textures and slender components. Although the generated synthetic dataset is diverse, it lacks the detailed complexity found in real-world objects (such as organic forms or mechanical parts), affecting its applicability in practical scenarios. Moreover, the current label-based conditional control is limited to predefined categories, and it does not adequately support fine-grained adjustments for attributes like size, style, or material.

## Future Directions

To overcome these limitations, future research could focus on the following directions: firstly, exploring lightweight architectures (such as sparse convolutions) or adopting distillation techniques to reduce computational overhead; secondly, combining progressive upsampling or hybrid 2D-3D approaches to enhance the resolution and details of generated voxels; thirdly, expanding the dataset by incorporating scanned 3D objects to enrich the realism of the generated results; and finally, introducing multi-label or text-guided generation to further enhance the flexibility of conditional control.
